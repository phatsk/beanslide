About
===

Beanslide is a simple bookmarklet for use with [Beanstalk](http://beanstalkapp.com/). On Code view pages (such as
"Changes" in Code Review), you can use beanslide to automatically hide files matching a mask, or toggle files by
clicking their headers.

Installation
===

Clone the repository and `npm install; grunt` to build the `build/beanslide.min.js` file. Copy this file's contents
into a Bookmark in your favorite browser (tested on Chrome, but should be fine elsewhere) and use it when you're on a
Beanstalk page.

Todo
===

* Need to add screenshots
* Figure out releases
